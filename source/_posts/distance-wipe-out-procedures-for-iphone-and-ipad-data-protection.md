* In the pop-up box, tap**Enable** to set your device to automatic remote erase data settings after 10 failed passcode attempts.

## **Wrapping Up**

 Apple secures its devices by offering passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID locks. However, if you have set easy to guess passcode like 0000 or haven’t set a passcode at all, it would be an easy pie for someone to enter into it and access your information. Hence, to protect data on a lost iPhone, it is best to erase it remotely. To remote erase iPhone data, you should have done a couple of things before the device was stolen — Enable ‘Find My iPhone’ or ‘Erase Data’ feature on iPhone. Besides, if you have been using the iOS device for office work, contact your company’s IT department to remote wipe iPhone through Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync or MDM.
