You will not be able to access your contact list, call logs, or messages, be it your imessages, WhatsApp, etc.**But, why restore your iPhone** ?

 Sometimes, there are issues that cannot be handled and the only solution is to restore the device to factory settings.

3. Enter your**Apple ID and Passcode** to proceed. With this, the procedure to factory reset iPhone is complete

**Important!**

 Before resetting the iPhone device to factory settings, it would be a good practice to back up your device on your system. If you have not created a backup, you will not be able to restore the data back to your device, and all you will lose all your data. You can use iCloud or iTunes to back up your iPhone data. If anything anomalous occurs, all the data can be restored from the most recent backup files right from anywhere.

**How to recover deleted data from your iPhone:**

 Even if you have not backed up your iPhone data, there’s still a solution. You can now retrieve all your erased data from your iPhone with **[Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/)**  .

 The tool provides the option to recover data through multiple channels. Since we need to recover data that has been erased after a factory reset, we need to select**‘Recover from iPhone’** option from the main interface of the tool.

 **Follow the steps below to restore your deleted data:**

1. **Connect your iPhone device** to the system. The tool will then begin to analyze the device for detecting the previously existing files from the connected device. The tool will generate a preview for all the folders and incorporated contents within its panel.
