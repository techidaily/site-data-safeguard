## **How to Prevent Corrupted Photos?**

 You are now aware of how free photo repair software can help in repairing corrupted images. However, a few tips can help you prevent image corruption in the future.

**1\. Ensure to use a compatible photo viewer**

 If you are getting error messages while trying to view your images, there is a high possibility that your viewer is not compatible and outdated. This is why you need to make sure that you have installed the latest and compatible image viewer in your system.

**2** .**Use Storage Media Properly**

 Some people eject the storage drive carelessly, which leads to corruption or damage to the media files stored in them. To avoid corruption of media files stored in various storage media, you must insert and eject them by following the correct procedure.

**3\. Avoid interruption**

 Make sure that there is no interruption while you are saving, sharing and downloading, or transferring the media files across systems. Because interruption can lead to data loss scenarios that can damage or corrupt your files.
