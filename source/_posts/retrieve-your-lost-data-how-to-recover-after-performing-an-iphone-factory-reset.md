 If you detect anything anomalous on your iPhone, you may need to reset it to factory settings. However, after a factory reset, you will lose all the data stored in your device. You will not be able to access your contact list, call logs, or messages, be it your imessages, WhatsApp, etc.**But, why restore your iPhone** ?

 Sometimes, there are issues that cannot be handled and the only solution is to restore the device to factory settings. This is usually done when the device functions abnormally or the performance is extremely slow. If your iPhone is restored to factory settings, every single bit of personal information will be permanently deleted from the device, and this may prevent others from getting access to your personal information.

**How to reset your iPhone to Factory Settings** :

 To reset your iPhone to factory settings, follow the steps below:

1. Click**Settings** and then select**General**
2. Select**Reset** and click on**Erase** **all** **contents** **and** **settings** . The interface will prompt you to key in your**Apple** **ID and Passcode**
3. Enter your**Apple ID and Passcode** to proceed. With this, the procedure to factory reset iPhone is complete

**Important!**

 Before resetting the iPhone device to factory settings, it would be a good practice to back up your device on your system. If you have not created a backup, you will not be able to restore the data back to your device, and all you will lose all your data. You can use iCloud or iTunes to back up your iPhone data. If anything anomalous occurs, all the data can be restored from the most recent backup files right from anywhere.

**How to recover deleted data from your iPhone:**

 Even if you have not backed up your iPhone data, there’s still a solution. You can now retrieve all your erased data from your iPhone with **[Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/)**  . The tool is powered by sophisticated recovery algorithms that help restore all the data components back to your iPhone after a factory reset.

 The tool provides the option to recover data through multiple channels. Since we need to recover data that has been erased after a factory reset, we need to select**‘Recover from iPhone’** option from the main interface of the tool.

 **Follow the steps below to restore your deleted data:**

1. **Connect your iPhone device** to the system. The tool will then begin to analyze the device for detecting the previously existing files from the connected device. The tool will generate a preview for all the folders and incorporated contents within its panel.
2. You can then**select single or multiple files** for recovery that you have lost while resetting your iPhone.
3. The iPhone recovery tool**will provide dual options** to store data either on the hard drive on the computer or your connected iPhone device.

 Not only the tool provides the benefit to recover data from iPhone device, but you will also be able to **[recover data from iTunes or iCloud backup files](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/)**  . Also, the iOS recovery tool can also be used to recover data from**encrypted** **backup** **files** . However, to utilize this feature, it is important to have a backup.

**Important!**

* Backup your data before performing any huge operation on the iPhone device such as restoring the device to factory settings.
* It is a good practice to store iPhone data on iCloud and perform a regular backup to prevent data loss.
* Saving iPhone data to iCloud offers an ease of accessing data contents from anywhere, even if the data is deleted from your device.
* In addition to online backups, it is beneficial to retain a replica of existing data on another device such as a system hard drive or external storage media.
