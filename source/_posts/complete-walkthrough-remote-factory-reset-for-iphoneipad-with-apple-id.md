## **Method 3: Remote erase iPhone through Mobile Device Management**

![earse iphone using Mobile Device Management Profile on iPhone 11](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/remotely-erase-iphone-and-ipad/data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MTYzMDo3MDY5-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDcxMyIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MTMiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)

 More businesses now rely on mobile devices for remote work. Hence, they usually have robust Mobile Device Management (MDM) system. In the remote work environment, the MDM manages mobile devices to secure business-critical corporate data.

 If your mobile device is lost, the MDM solution can track location, lock, and even wipe all data from the device remotely to protect critical corporate information from a leak.

 So in case of loss or theft, contact your organization’s IT administrator. They can remotely delete data from iPhone or iPad.

## **Method 4: Auto erase iPhone data remotely after multiple failed passcode attempts**

 Like ‘Find My’ app, ‘Erase Data’ option should be enabled on your lost iPhone to delete its data remotely. The feature works when anyone attempts to access your iPhone by trying multiple wrong passcodes. The iPhone data automatically gets erased after 10 failed attempts.

 So if you are apprehensive about your confidential iPhone data reaching in the wrong hands, set your device to auto-erase data.

 **Follow the below steps for automatic remote erase iPhone data after 10 failed passcode entries:**

* On your iPhone navigate to**Settings > Touch ID & Passcode** (or Face ID & Passcode).

![Automatic erase iPhone after 10 failed passcode entry using Settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/remotely-erase-iphone-and-ipad/data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MTYzMjo3OTE=-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTgwIDgwMCIgd2lkdGg9Ijk4MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)

* Toggle on**Erase Data** .

![click Enable to set iPhone to automatic remote erase 10 wrong passcode entries.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/remotely-erase-iphone-and-ipad/data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MTYzODo2OTc=-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNjAwIDU3OCIgd2lkdGg9IjYwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1NzgiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)

## **Wrapping Up**

 Apple secures its devices by offering passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID locks. However, if you have set easy to guess passcode like 0000 or haven’t set a passcode at all, it would be an easy pie for someone to enter into it and access your information. Hence, to protect data on a lost iPhone, it is best to erase it remotely. To remote erase iPhone data, you should have done a couple of things before the device was stolen — Enable ‘Find My iPhone’ or ‘Erase Data’ feature on iPhone. Besides, if you have been using the iOS device for office work, contact your company’s IT department to remote wipe iPhone through Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync or MDM.
