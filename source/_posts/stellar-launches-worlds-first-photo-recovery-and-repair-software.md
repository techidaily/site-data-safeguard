 Catering to the needs of both professionals and consumers, the new suite of Stellar Photo Recovery is an exciting leap from its current recovery offerings — as an all-purpose application for restoring lost/deleted as well as corrupt multimedia files . It is especially helpful to repair photos & videos that get corrupt during the process of transfer, editing or conversion.

 The new software variants effectively restore the lost multimedia files in all common lost case scenarios — accidental deletion, formatting, virus attack, partition losses, Operating System crash, media corruption, and many others.

 Its powerful repair engine fixes corruption in digital photos and even 4K HD videos. Along with JPEG/JPG, the software can repair RAW file formats of all popular brands of cameras including Sony, Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Fuji etc. It effectively repairs both visual and audio corruptions in videos .
