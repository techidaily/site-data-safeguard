## **How to Prevent Corrupted Photos?**

 You are now aware of how free photo repair software can help in repairing corrupted images. However, a few tips can help you prevent image corruption in the future.

**2** .**Use Storage Media Properly**

 Some people eject the storage drive carelessly, which leads to corruption or damage to the media files stored in them. To avoid corruption of media files stored in various storage media, you must insert and eject them by following the correct procedure.

**3\. Avoid interruption**
