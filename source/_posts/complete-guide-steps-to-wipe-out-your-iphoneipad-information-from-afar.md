**The 3 pre-conditions to remote wipe iPhone using ‘Find My’:**

1. The ‘Find My iPhone’ option should be enabled via**Settings > Find my > Find My iPhone** on the lost iPhone.
2. The missing iPhone/ iPad should be connected to Internet when erase iPhone command is initiated.
3. To erase iPhone remotely, you must use the same iCloud account that is enabled on the lost iPhone.

 **In steps: How to remote erase iPhone/ iPad using ‘Find My iPhone’ via iCloud:**

 If your iPhone is connected to Wi-Fi or a data network, the remote erase begins. If the lost iPhone is off or not connected to Internet, the remote erase begins whenever the device is online. After you set your iPhone for remote erase**,** Apple sends a confirmation email to your Apple ID email. You can also cancel the erase request if required.

**Caution** : After you erase your iPhone, you cannot locate it through the ‘Find My’ app. Hence, only erase your device when you are certain it is lost, sold, or donated and you cannot get it back.

## **Method 2: Use Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync to wipe iPhone remotely**

![MS Exchange account on iPhone 11](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/remotely-erase-iphone-and-ipad/data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MTYzMDo1MzYw-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgODAwIDgwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjgwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)

 If you were accessing your office mailbox on lost iPhone, the device must be using Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. The Exchange synchronization protocol synchronizes the organization’s mailbox with a mobile phone.

 So if your iOS device is misplaced or stolen, immediately contact your company’s system administrator to remote wipe iPhone or iPad.

 More businesses now rely on mobile devices for remote work. Hence, they usually have robust Mobile Device Management (MDM) system. In the remote work environment, the MDM manages mobile devices to secure business-critical corporate data.

 If your mobile device is lost, the MDM solution can track location, lock, and even wipe all data from the device remotely to protect critical corporate information from a leak.

 So in case of loss or theft, contact your organization’s IT administrator. They can remotely delete data from iPhone or iPad.

## **Method 4: Auto erase iPhone data remotely after multiple failed passcode attempts**

 Like ‘Find My’ app, ‘Erase Data’ option should be enabled on your lost iPhone to delete its data remotely. The feature works when anyone attempts to access your iPhone by trying multiple wrong passcodes. The iPhone data automatically gets erased after 10 failed attempts.

 So if you are apprehensive about your confidential iPhone data reaching in the wrong hands, set your device to auto-erase data.

 **Follow the below steps for automatic remote erase iPhone data after 10 failed passcode entries:**

* On your iPhone navigate to**Settings > Touch ID & Passcode** (or Face ID & Passcode).

![Automatic erase iPhone after 10 failed passcode entry using Settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/remotely-erase-iphone-and-ipad/data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MTYzMjo3OTE=-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTgwIDgwMCIgd2lkdGg9Ijk4MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)

* Enter your passcode when asked. In case you don’t have a passcode, Select**Turn Passcode On** and set a passcode.
* Toggle on**Erase Data** .

* In the pop-up box, tap**Enable** to set your device to automatic remote erase data settings after 10 failed passcode attempts.

## **Wrapping Up**

 Apple secures its devices by offering passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID locks. However, if you have set easy to guess passcode like 0000 or haven’t set a passcode at all, it would be an easy pie for someone to enter into it and access your information. Hence, to protect data on a lost iPhone, it is best to erase it remotely. To remote erase iPhone data, you should have done a couple of things before the device was stolen — Enable ‘Find My iPhone’ or ‘Erase Data’ feature on iPhone. Besides, if you have been using the iOS device for office work, contact your company’s IT department to remote wipe iPhone through Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync or MDM.
